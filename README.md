**Weav** is a tool for nice communications. It's what I would envision a communications system rid of clutter (personal information) and full of ideas (microcontent). Weav is a mashup of concepts found in Twitter micropublishing, IRC channels and Facebook messaging, without the inherent centralisation.

The whitepaper is the authoratative resource on theory. This document is a must-read for any contributor to the codebase, and serves to inform those as to how Weav works and why. It is **written to be read in its entirety, chronologically**.
