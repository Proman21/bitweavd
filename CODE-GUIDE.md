The bitWeav client (shortened to Weav) is served to the user as a static website, generated by Jekyll, and made dynamic by AngularJS and DOM updates from WebRTC communications.

## Development process

## Git
Because we use Github as our hosting infrastructure, we need to maintain a stable version on a seperate branch - **gh-pages**, which is then served to the end user. Both the documentation and source files are kept on the **master** branch. The **gh-pages** branch is updated to new stable versions manually (if you think you have a better way of doing this, tell me!). 

## Libraries
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a build system for the web application.
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) as a general CSS framework. 
* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) included for Bootstrap and sweet DOM API.
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) for clean CSS styling. 
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for JS modularity. 
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) used as a general web application framework.

## Technologies
We use the [Cache Manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5) feature of HTML5 to provide offline access to the web application.
