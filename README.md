NOTE: README still in progress, as is Weav.

**Weav** is an innovation and a tool, and thus is marketed accordingly:
* **As a tool:** Weav is what you would get if you combined **Skype**, **Facebook Chat** and **Twitter tweets** but without the inherent centralisation - this means that you won't rely on Facebook's servers, Facebook will not be able to read your private conversations and there is no set up required. It's the first communications platform that can be set up by simply visiting a webpage - it runs entirely in your browser, you don't need to register and everything you send is secure (not even the government can break this security). It's what I would envision a communications system rid of clutter (personal information) and full of ideas (microcontent).
* **As an innovation:** Weav is the first web-based decentralised and peer-to-peer communications platform. It's the first platform that employs a publish-subscribe overlay that doesn't unnecessarily involve nodes who don't care about a topic - this is a marvellous innovation called Poldercast, built by [these guys](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/papers/PolderCast.pdfâ€Ž). It's the first peer-to-peer autonomous communications platform - unlike Retroshare, nodes need not be specifically invited to chat in a group. It's the first peer-to-peer innovation built on web technologies (HTML5, WebRTC). 

# Docs
The whitepaper is the authoratative resource on theory. This document is a must-read for any contributor to the codebase, and serves to inform those as to how Weav works and why. It is **written to be read in its entirety, chronologically**.
