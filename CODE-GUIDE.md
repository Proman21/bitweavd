Due to the unique nature of this project, there is no necessity to run a locally hosted server. Simply by visiting src/index.html you can view the most recent version of the bitWeav client. However because we use Github as our hosting infrastructure, we need to maintain a stable version on a seperate branch - **gh-pages**, which is then served to the end user. 

Both the documentation and source files are kept on the **master** branch. The **gh-pages** branch is updated to new stable versions manually (if you think you have a better way of doing this, tell me!).

We use the [Cache Manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5) feature of HTML5 to provide offline access to the web application.
