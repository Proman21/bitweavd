**Weav** is an innovation and a tool, so I can explain it in two different ways:

### As a tool
Weav is what you would get if you combined **Skype**, **IRC** and **Twitter tweets** but without the inherent centralisation — this means that you won't rely on Microsoft or Twitter's servers, third-parties (including the NSA) will not be able to read your private conversations and there is no set up required. 

It's the first communications platform that is built entirely on web technologies — you don't need to register and everything you send is secure (not even the government can break this security). It's what I would envision a communications system rid of clutter (personal information) and full of ideas (microcontent).

### As an innovation
Weav is the first web-based decentralised and peer-to-peer communications platform. It's the first platform that employs a publish-subscribe overlay that doesn't unnecessarily involve nodes who don't care about a topic — this is a marvellous innovation called Poldercast, built by [these guys](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/papers/PolderCast.pdf‎). It's the first peer-to-peer autonomous communications platform — unlike Retroshare, nodes need not be specifically invited to chat in a group. It's the first peer-to-peer innovation built on web technologies (HTML5, WebRTC). 

# Use cases
**Twitter alternative** 
**Skype alternative:** Weav is more sustainable through not relying on Microsoft's servers and being open-source and thus being free forever, secure through an open codebase for review (unlike Skype which is bugged by Microsoft) and lastly has more features.
**Lightweight peer-to-peer link indexing:** using Weav in conjunction with magnet links, it is possible to achieve a decentralised peer-to-peer system for publish/subscribe of files. BitTorrent magnet links are typically 70 characters, which leaves ample space for tagging. 


# Docs
The whitepaper is the authoratative resource on theory. This document is a must-read for any contributor to the codebase, and serves to inform those as to how Weav works and why. It is **written to be read in its entirety, chronologically**.
