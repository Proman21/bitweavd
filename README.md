Weav is very much a project, and unlike a product, it has not been built nor marketed for the target audience yet. The only item worth looking at right now is the [whitepaper](https://github.com/liamzebedee/weav/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.tex).

Founded and built by [Liam (liamzebedee)](http://liamz.co).
